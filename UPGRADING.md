# Upgrading Notes

This document captures required refactoring on your part when upgrading to a module version that contains breaking changes.

## Upgrading to v3.0.0

### Variables (v3.0.0)

The following variables have been removed:

- `dynamodb_table`
- `dynamodb_deletion_protection`

The following variables have been introduced:
- `rules_filepath`
- `rules_s3_object_name`

The following variables have been renamed:
- `lambda_events_suppressor` -> `findings_manager_events_lambda`
- `lambda_streams_suppressor` -> `findings_manager_trigger_lambda`
- `lambda_suppressor_iam_role_name` -> `findings_manager_lambda_iam_role_name`
- `eventbridge_suppressor_iam_role_name` -> `jira_eventbridge_iam_role_name`
- `step_function_suppressor_iam_role_name` -> `jira_step_function_iam_role_name`

A Lambda function now triggers on S3 Object Creation Trigger Events.
By default it is triggered by putting a new (version of) an object called `rules.yaml` in the bucket created by this module.
This filename can be customized with the `rules_s3_object_name` variable.

You can add the `rules.yaml` file to the bucket in any way you like after deploying this module, for instance with an `aws_s3_object` resource.
This way you can separate management of your infrastructure and security.
If this separation is not necessary in your case you also let this module directly upload the file for you by setting the `rules_filepath` variable to a filepath to your `rules.yaml` file.
In either case, be mindful that there can be a delay between creating S3 triggers and those being fully functional.
Re-create the rules object later to have rules run on your findings history in that case.

### Outputs (v3.0.0)

The following output has been removed:

- `dynamodb_arn`

The following output has been renamed:

- `lambda_jira_security_hub_sg_id` -> `jira_lambda_sg_id`
- `lambda_securityhub_events_suppressor_sg_id` -> `findings_manager_events_lambda_sg_id`
- `lambda_securityhub_streams_suppressor_sg_id` -> `findings_manager_trigger_lambda_sg_id`

### Behaviour (v3.0.0)

New functionality:

- Managing consolidated control findings is now supported
- Managing based on tags is now supported

See the README, section `## How to format the rules.yaml file?` for more information on the keys you need to use to control this.

The `rules.yaml` file needs to be written in a different syntax. The script below can be used to easily convert your current `suppressions.yml` file to the new format.

```python
import yaml

suppressions = yaml.safe_load(open('suppressions.yml'))['Suppressions']

rules = {
    'Rules': [
        {
            'note': content['notes'],
            'action': content['action'],
            'match_on': {
                'rule_or_control_id': rule_or_control_id,
                'resource_id_regexps': content['rules']
            }
        }
        for rule_or_control_id, contents in suppressions.items()
        for content in contents
    ]
}

print(yaml.dump(rules, indent=2))
```

If you do not want to rename your file from `suppressions.yml` to `rules.yaml` you can override the name using the `rules_s3_object_name` variable. 

## Upgrading to v2.0.0

### Variables (v2.0.0)

The following variable has been replaced:

- `create_allow_all_egress_rule` -> `jira_integration.security_group_egress_rules`, `lambda_streams_suppressor.security_group_egress_rules`, `lambda_events_suppressor.security_group_egress_rules`

Instead of only being able to allow all egress or block all egress and having to rely on resources outside this module to create specific egress rules this is now supported natively by the module.

The following variable defaults have been modified:

- `servicenow_integration.cloudwatch_retention_days` -> default: `365` (previous hardcoded: `14`). In order to comply with AWS Security Hub control CloudWatch.16.

### Behaviour (v2.0.0)

The need to provide a `providers = { aws = aws }` argument has been removed, but is still allowed. E.g. when deploying this module in the audit account typically `providers = { aws = aws.audit }` is passed.

## Upgrading to v1.0.0

### Behaviour (v1.0.0)

- Timeouts of the suppressor lambdas have been increased to 120 seconds. The current timeout of 60 seconds is not always enough to process 100 records of findings.
- The `create_servicenow_access_keys` variable, now called `servicenow_integration.create_access_keys` was not used in the code and therefore the default behaviour was that access keys would be created. This issue has been resolved.
- The `create_allow_all_egress_rule` variable has been set to `false`.
- The `tags` variable is now optional.

### Variables (v1.0.0)

The following variables have been replaced by a new variable `jira_integration`:

- `jira_exclude_account_filter` -> `jira_integration.exclude_account_ids`
- `jira_finding_severity_normalized` -> `jira_integration.finding_severity_normalized_threshold`
- `jira_integration` -> `jira_integration.enabled`
- `jira_issue_type` -> `jira_integration.issue_type`
- `jira_project_key` -> `jira_integration.project_key`
- `jira_secret_arn` -> `jira_integration.credentials_secret_arn`
- `lambda_jira_name` -> `jira_integration.lambda_settings.name`
- `lambda_jira_iam_role_name` -> `jira_integration.lambda_settings.iam_role_name`
- Additionally you are now able to specify the `log_level`, `memory_size,` and `timeout` of the lambda.

The following variables have been replaced by a new variable `servicenow_integration`:

- `servicenow_integration` -> `servicenow_integration.enabled`
- `create_servicenow_access_keys` -> `servicenow_integration.create_access_keys`

The following variables have been replaced by a new variable `lambda_events_suppressor`:

- `lambda_events_suppressor_name` -> `lambda_events_suppressor.name`
- Additionally you are now able to specify the `log_level`, `memory_size,` and `timeout` of the lambda.

The following variables have been replaced by a new variable `lambda_streams_suppressor`:

- `lambda_streams_suppressor_name` -> `lambda_streams_suppressor.name`
- Additionally you are now able to specify the `log_level`, `memory_size,` and `timeout` of the lambda.
